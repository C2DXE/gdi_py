# gdi_py


A python library for GDI in win32gui (It takes https://github.com/Leo-Aqua/Python-gdi-repo scripts and makes them into a library for easy handling)

Commands:

gdi.gdicolor(time,repeat) ##It just shows many colors in the screen, time for how long do you want the command to run (I recommend around 100-200) repeat is for how many times do you want it to repeat, put around 100 (Ik it's redundant)##

gdi.gdiblackwhite(time,repeat) ##Same as gdicolor but black and white, same parameters##

gdi.invert(time) ##It just inverts the colors, I reccomend around 200-500 time or it will be too short##

gdi.errorscreen(time,repeat) ##It shows many error images in the screen, i reccomend 500 for time and 500 for repeat##

gdi.panscreen(time) ##Hard to explain, just try it out##

gdi.waves(time) ##It makes waves in a line and goes all around the screen, but they are boring af##

gdi.rainbowhell(time) ##Glitches all the screen out (try it, it's very fun)##

gdi.bwhell(time) ##Same as rainbowhell but with black and white##
